The recipe workflow (see .trig files) as 5 nanopublications.

Each of the 4 steps in the workflow has its own nanopublication containing only information about that step.
The 5th nanopub describes the topology of the workflow itself (i.e. which steps belong to this workflow, and what ordering they have).

Python script that converted the recipe rdf is in ```convert_recipe_to_nanopubs.py```.
