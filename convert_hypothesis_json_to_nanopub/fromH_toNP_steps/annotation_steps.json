A total of 3-6 slices can be mounted on a glass slide, depending on the size of the slices. Ensure that the slices are completely straight and not folded. Make sure to leave enough spaces in the edges for the liquid blocker marker. Allow to thoroughly dry.After slices have dried, draw a rectangle with liquid blocking marker to prevent leakage of solutions. Wash slices 6 times with PBS for 5 minutes. Prepare a blocking solution by adding 250 µL of goat serum, 50 µL of 10% Triton X and complete to a 5 mL volume using 1X PBS. Block slides for 30 min with the blocking solution. Aspirate the blocking solution and apply primary antibody (1:500 dilution, or the appropriate dilution for the antibody, in blocking solution). Let incubate overnight at 4ºC (or as appropriate for the antibody) with a wet paper towel to avoid desiccation.The following day aspirate the primary antibody.

Make sure to cover slides completely with the solution.Apply secondary antibody (1:500 dilution, or as appropriate, in blocking solution) and incubate for 2 hours at room temperature (or as appropriate) in a light shielded area with a wet paper towel to avoid desiccation.Aspirate the secondary antibody and wash three times with 1X PBS. This would be an appropriate time to apply DAPI or other water-soluble counterstains. For example, if this was an Alzheimer’s disease mouse model and labeling of amyloid plaques was desired, apply Methoxy-X04 diluted 1:250 in 1X PBS and incubate at room temperature for 15 minutes. Wash 2 times with 80% ethanol. Then, allow slides to thoroughly dry before mounting. Use a mounting medium of preference (we recommend Prolong Gold).

Perform a cut from below the ribs to the upper chest in order to expose the chest cavity. Attach hemostats to the ribs and retract in order to fully expose the heart. Insert a 21G needle attached to a perfusion pump containing 1X PBS into the left ventricle, and then perform a small cut in the right atrium. Start to pump 1X PBS to the mouse, until the fluid runs clear out of the cut in the right atrium. The liver changing from a deep red to a paler shade is an indicator of a good perfusion.CRITICAL STEP: further perfusion with 4% PFA should be avoided as half of the brain will be used for protein extraction and immunostaining results have shown significant improvement when skipping this step.

Insert a 22-25G needle with a 3 mL syringe just under the ribs at the body centerline. The needle should hit the heart approximately at the level of the elbow (Figure 1). Gently, withdraw the syringe plunger until blood starts to come out. If blood doesn’t come out, move the syringe slightly upwards or downwards until blood is readily withdrawn. A volume of 1-2 mL can be extracted with this technique.

This step needs to be done as fast as possible to ensure that vessels won’t collapse before the transcardial perfusion. CAUTION: applying too much back pressure can collapse the heart muscle thus interfering with the blood extraction.Rapidly transfer the blood to a vacutainer blood collection tube with EDTA. If the blood will be used for RNA extraction, apply three parts of Trizol LS per one part of blood, and process immediately or snap freeze for later processing. If the blood will sit for more than a minute in the syringe before transferring to a container with EDTA, then it may be advisable to add some EDTA to the syringe to coat the inside.STOP POINT: samples can be stored at -80ºC until further processing or can be processed fresh.
